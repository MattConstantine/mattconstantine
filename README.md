## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt Constantine and I am a cellist and composer based in London,UK.
You can hear my cello playing in films, AAA video games and prime time TV dramas.
You can hear music I've composed in all sorts of random programmes - synched all over the globe.

## It's All Noise

A while back I started making sample libraries for Kontakt as a means of rewarding clients
who booked me for recording sessions.  This has progressed into a boutique sample company 
and I'm using GitHub to track the development of present and future libraries.
