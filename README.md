## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt Constantine and I am a cellist, composer and virtual instrument developer based in London,UK.
You can hear my cello playing in films, AAA video games and prime time TV dramas.
You can hear music I've composed in all sorts of random programmes - synched all over the globe.
Cello Sessions available at https://mattconstantine.co.uk/online-session-cello/
